# Waste Sorting Image Classifier

This is a waste sorting image classifier built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of waste into two categories: "Organic" and "Recyclable." The model is trained on a dataset of waste images and is capable of predicting the type of waste based on input images.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an image classifier that can automatically sort waste into organic and recyclable categories. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it uses transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 and InceptionV3 to achieve high accuracy even with a limited dataset.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

The dataset used for training and validation consists of images of waste items, collected from various sources. The images are preprocessed using the ImageDataGenerator class from Keras to apply data augmentation and scaling.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on a pre-trained CNN (VGG16 or InceptionV3) with added layers to suit the classification task. The model includes convolutional layers with ReLU activation, max-pooling layers, and dense layers with a softmax activation for classification.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated on a separate validation dataset to monitor its performance. To prevent overfitting, regularization techniques such as dropout and batch normalization are used. Class weights are also introduced to address class imbalance in the dataset.

## Model Deployment

The trained model can be deployed for real-time waste sorting applications. To make predictions, a single image can be preprocessed using OpenCV and fed into the model. The model will then classify the waste item as "Organic" or "Recyclable."

## Usage

To use the trained model for making predictions, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install tensorflow opencv-python`.

2. Load the trained model using `tf.keras.models.load_model()`.

3. Preprocess the input image using OpenCV and convert it to the required format.

4. Use the loaded model's `predict()` method to make predictions.
